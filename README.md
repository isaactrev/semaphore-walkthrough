# A Beginner‚Äôs Walkthrough of Semaphore

This project is a simplified walkthrough of how [Semaphore](https://semaphore.pse.dev/) works ‚Äî a zero-knowledge protocol that enables anonymous signaling, voting, and feedback within a verified group. The goal is to demystify the core steps by walking through a functional example built on top of Semaphore‚Äôs official boilerplate.

## üîç Project Overview

Semaphore enables anonymous group membership and private signaling using zero-knowledge proofs. This project walks through:

1. **Identity Creation**  
   Users create a zk identity locally in their browser (trapdoor, nullifier, commitment).

2. **Group Membership**  
   Commitments are added to a Merkle tree, forming a privacy-preserving group.

3. **Feedback & Voting**  
   Users anonymously prove membership and submit a signal (feedback or vote) without revealing their identity.

This short 5-minute video walks through the three main UI screens (Identity, Group, Feedback) and explains how the Semaphore protocol works under the hood.
